Abstract </br></br>
A social-networked system of human service provision would allow for 1) the flow of resources without top-down or third-party monitoring, 2) novel and predictive measures of regional human service sector robustness, completelness, and interrelatedness, 3) better signaling for more efficient intra and inter organization resource allocation by local stakeholders.  Such a system would provide the fundamental infrastructure for accelerated invention and innovation in human services.</br></br>

Such a system would require: 1) open networked systems for peer-to-peer communication and service referral, 2) a novel structure for data ownership, 3) publically available anonomized metadata about social service provision and capacity, 4) increased system sensitivity towards demand for services in the form of freely available informaiton, 5) the ability to understand and measure the rate of change from population dependence on social services to integration with their for-profit corresponding services.

</br></br>

Benefiaries of such a system would be: 1) Human service providers, 2) researchers and policy makers, 3) funders, 4) human service clients

INTRODUCTION:
</br></br>
EXAMPLE: A story about systemic vulnability:
1) regional human service ecosystem, 2) a small human service provider, 3) a large human service provider, 4) human service client, 5) researchers and policy makers

</br></br>
Assumption 1: More information and decentralization of decision making is better than less information and centralization of decision making.</br>

Formula: [cost of information gathering and analysis]+[cost of decision making] / [value of decisions] </br></br>

Assumption 2: More positive spillover effects are better than fewer positive spillover effects. </br>

Assumption 3: A more robust system of service provision is better than a less robust system of service provision. </br>

Current problem framework 1: management of the commons </br> 
Summary: "When excusion is difficult, [consumption is not costly,] and consumption is subtractive resource users have incentives to [i. overuse resources], ii. freeride on provisional infrastructure, iii. [fail to contribute back towards] the maintenance of the provisional infrastructure." Therefore we see incentives for resource providers like large foundations and government entities to favor i. fewer and larger service providers to ease centralization about and control allocation of resources. </br></br>

Current problem framwork 2: The best way to understand the impact of social services is through an organizational SROI analysis that accounts for 1) the direct value of services provided, 2) the indirect value of services provided in the form of tax-base benefits and potential spill-over to other social service providers. Such an SROI can also include advanced evaluation methods such as control groups, estimating counterfactuals, behavioral economics, and multi-variate regressions.  </br>

THESIS 1: Fewer service providers means a less robust system of service provision. </br>

THESIS 2: Consuption of social services is costly to consumers. </br>

THESIS 3: The best way to understand the impact of social services is through a comprehensive analysis of long-term network robustness. By robustness we mean systemic tolerance towards 1) external shocks in the form of adverse economic events, large and rapid shifts in demographics, rapid adverse changes in public infrastructure and provision resulting from political or legal change, and natural disasters; 2) internal shocks in the form of "rapid reorganization of the ecological or social system induced by" the social service sector itself.

THESIS 4: SROI analysis is limited to short-term valuation of services, and thus when used exclusively leads to brittle and unstable social service provision networks.
